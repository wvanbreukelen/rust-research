# rust-research

Repository for my Rust research, orientated towards whether is possible to use Rust within courses of the Computer Engineering study programme. A Hardware Abstraction Layer is developed to support theory with practical use.

## svd2rust
[svd2rust](https://github.com/rust-embedded/svd2rust) is used to offer an embedded developer the possibility to access hardware peripherals in a (more)-safe manner. It is also used within this project to simplify hardware access and make optimal use of Rust memory safety features.
